            <p style="color: rgba(7,30,84,.6);text-align: justify;font-size: 13px;">The formative years that a child spends at school are perhaps the most instrumental in shaping the future of the child.
            Recognizing this the school is deeply committed to providing the children with a stimulating and positive environment
            that facilitates the development of the children into capable, confident and responsible individuals who are equipped
            with all the requisite skills to carve out a niche for themselves, as they step out into the world. The core purpose of
            Indian Convent School is to create an inclusive community of confident, motivated and successful learners, and we aim to
            achieve this by the following measures -</p>
